# 🚀 Product Store REST API

Welcome to my **Product Store REST API**, a fully functional backend service built as part of my journey into backend development. This project includes full CRUD operations, image uploads, and proper documentation — all deployed and ready to use!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js** + **Express.js**
- **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud database
- **Cloudinary** for image uploads
- **RESTful API** with standard CRUD operations
- **Postman** for API documentation and testing
